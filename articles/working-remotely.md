# How We Work Remotely @Momentum

Everyone at Momentum, staff and students included, is expected to be online and available to each other between the core hours of 9:30-5:30 each weekday. 

## Taking Breaks

Please take a one-hour break away from the computer for lunch! Set your status to let people know you’re not available.

If you need to step away for another reason at any time, please let the campus manager or an instructor know. We understand that everyone has responsibilities outside of work, so just let people know what you’re up to. 

## Slack

* **Use your status** to let people know if you are online and available or if you are away from your computer for lunch or personal matters.

* You don't need to respond immediately to Slack messages, but **try to get back to people within the same day**. An hour or two can be fine if you are very busy, but please check regularly to make sure people are not waiting on you for a response.

* Please **use the public team channel** for any questions that would be of general interest or benefit. This includes questions about events, deadlines, or technical questions about code.

* If you would like a specific person's input, for example a classmate who has worked on the same issue or an instructor, you can **@ a person using their Slack handle**, like so: "@Clinton, how do we get only certain objects from the database again?"

* Reserve private messages for personal interactions.

### How to ask a technical question in Slack

Asking precise questions about code is another skill that requires practice before it becomes familiar. It can be hard to find the right words, or even know what to ask. It’s ok not to get the phrasing right, and **it’s ok to ask about anything you are having trouble with**.

* Describe the problem you are seeing as precisely as you can. Ask for what you need, whether it’s a clarification, a suggestion, a resource, help spotting an error...whatever.

* Take a screenshot of what you are seeing if it would help someone help you.

    * [How to take a screenshot on a Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201361) 

    * To share it, add it to a Slack message by clicking the paperclip button at the bottom right of the input box, or dragging the file from your desktop into the Slack window.

* If you are working with some lines of code, copy and paste it in your message or include a GitHub link. 

    * Format code in Slack using three backticks like this: ```

(the backtick key is at the top left of your keyboard.)

**Everyone is welcome to answer technical questions asked in Slack**. If you are asking a question and want the attention of a specific person or specific people, you can use the ‘@’ symbol and their Slack username to notify them.

## Remote classroom

* Please **keep your video on** during class. We like to be able to see each other’s faces during class!

* **Please keep your mic muted unless you are currently talking**. That lets everyone hear the current speaker more clearly. On Zoom, you can use the spacebar to quickly and temporarily mute or unmute yourself.

* If you have connection problems or can't join via computer for whatever reason, you can use the phone number to call in to the meeting and join via audio.

* **If you would like to ask a question, you can use the raise hand feature** or use our classroom channel on Slack to type questions during class.

* Use [the feedback options in Zoom](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115001286183-Nonverbal-Feedback-During-Meetings#h_50523139-7bac-403b-9c59-1755ada65ad9), found under the Participants tab.

* Minimize distractions in your environment as much as possible. Consider[ turning on your  "Do Not Disturb" setting on your computer](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/use-do-not-disturb-mchl999b7c1a/mac) during class. 

### Daily class-related information for your team

Material from each class, including links to the day’s project, any information you need for that day’s work, and links to video recordings of class when they are available will be posted by your instructor on your team’s classroom page. 

Team One’s page can be found here: [https://momentum-team-1.github.io/](https://momentum-team-1.github.io/)

## Working outside of class time

* Join the [Momentum Co-Working Room](https://zoom.us/j/705824048) to work alongside other students remotely. This is our virtual common space for connecting with your classmates while class is not in session. Instructors and staff members will often be in there as well. It’s ok to use this space to socialize and chat with each other!

* **Use Slack** to ask questions or share things you’ve discovered while you are working.

    * **Please use public channels for any code-related questions**. The #team or #codehelp channels are good options!

    * Explore other channels: #general is for all Momentum students, including alums. #random is for fun and non-work related things. 

* Use collaboration tools to help each other or get help from an instructor. Use **the VS Code LiveShare extension** to be able to work collaboratively in your editor. Other screen-sharing tools, like the screen share built into Zoom or [Screen](https://screen.so/#/home) might also be useful.  

## Working in groups

* Schedule regular video meetings using a tool everyone feels comfortable with. Students have had success using Google Meets, Zoom, and Discord.

* You can pair to write code using VS Code LiveShare.

* Important team decisions that happen verbally in a conversation should be documented in writing in a public place, like on a Trello board or pinned to a Slack channel.

* Slack conversations should take place in shared channels as much as possible. Private DMs should be reserved for personal interactions.

*  If you are meeting on a video or audio call, establish and agree to a procedure for speaking in turn and making sure that everyone has an opportunity to be heard. 

* It may be helpful to have a group leader for each remote meeting. The leader’s job is to moderate the conversation. The leader can ask people by name if they would like to speak, so that everyone is invited to contribute.

* Consensus is still important. Find out if all members of the group are in agreement by asking people by name if they agree.
