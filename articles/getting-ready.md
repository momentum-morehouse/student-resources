# Getting ready for class: an alternative to Foundations

If you cannot take our Foundations class before you start our immersive program, we have a solution for you! We've picked out two different paths -- one for people who like videos and one for people who prefer reading -- for you to take.

Before you get started, though, reach out to the person you've been working with for enrollment and ask them to connect you to an instructor. We'll go ahead and add you to our chat system (Slack) and set up a conversation with you and an instructor to help you get started.

## Videos

If you prefer watching videos, go to the YouTube playlist [Web Development Tutorials for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoYCgNOIyGAB_8_iq1cL8MVeun7cB6eNc). There are many videos there. The ones we recommend you watch and work through are:

- Web development Tutorial for Beginners
- HTML Tutorial for Beginners
- CSS Tutorial for Beginners
- Hand-code an HTML + CSS layout
- Build an HTML + CSS Layout with Flexbox
- Building multiple pages
- CSS Selectors Made Easy
- Ways to code images
- Introduction to JavaScript
- JS Tutorial Part 2 - if/else
- JS Tutorial Part 3 - functions
- How the Internet Works for Developers - Pt 1

## Tutorials

If you prefer reading, go to the [Learn Web Development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) section on the Mozilla Developer Network. (This site, known as _MDN_, will be an essential reference for you throughout the course.) You should read and work through the following sections.

- Complete beginners start here!
    - You can skip "Publishing Your Website"
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript first steps
- JavaScript building blocks

## Next steps

If you work through all of the above, you'll know what you need to in order to start class. If you have more time left over, we recommend going ahead and [getting your computer set up for class](setup.md).
