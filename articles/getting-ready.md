# Getting ready for class: Foundations

If you'd like to get a head start before the first class, we've got resource for you! We've picked out two different paths -- one for people who like videos and one for people who prefer reading -- for you to take.

Before you get started, though, reach out to the person you've been working with for enrollment and ask them to connect you to an instructor. We'll go ahead and add you to our chat system (Slack) and set up a conversation with you and an instructor to help you get started.
